1. If we multipliy all the prime numbers less than a certin number and add 1 to it, then it will give a prime number.(euclidian's proof by contradiction)
	2*3*5 + 1 = 31
	this helps us to prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers and there no such thing called as the biggest prime

2. Apart from 2 and 3 all the prime numbers in this world gives either 1 or 5 as reminders when divided by 6(this doesn't say everything as prime but if it violated it then it is not a prime)

3. All numbers in this world can be prime factorized by a unique set of prime numbers
	eg: for 12 : (2,3)

4. Number of prime numbers upto a certin number x is approximately equal to x/ln(x) ; natural  logarithm to the base of e

5. Twin prime conjecture (conjecture : a thing without proof)
	There are infinitely many primes such that p and p+2 are primes
